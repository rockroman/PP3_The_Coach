### User Manual

<details><summary>Click here to view instructions</summary>

#### Overview
- Using this program user will create 5 players inside given parameters that allow certain creativity.In the next stage user will choose 3 different types of training ,each training got a value (that is not presented to a user, but user is warned that the higher the number of training that value is  higher)
that will Carry a half of the player overall value.next stage calls user to pick 3 food options for each player.also each option has a caloric value (not presented to a user ). so user has to use common sense for food options ,cause caloric value of the food will be compared to a user active metabolic rate that is calculated after input values for each player.Food options will carry another half of player value. final stage of program is giving feedback to user with final result got with calculating both halfs of user value and than getting overall value of team in percentage


#### Main Menu

- Main menu is presented to user with ASCII art of the program title
and short description of program instuctions.
at the bottom of menu user is presented with 2 options 
option to proceed and option to exit the program
input validation is implemented troughout program so if invalid or outside parameters input is given user will be prompted to repeat the input  

### exit
- program is terminated  

#### proceed

- this option will present user with 
another 2 options
1. new user 
2. existing user


#### New user registration (sign-up)

 - user is asked to create username and to put
 the email.
 - user email is validated with python (email_validator) library 
 - after both inputs are validated user credentials are stored into th database(google spreadsheet)


#### existing user

- this option will returnig user to input
email adress. if email is found in database program will retrieve users username and greet user with username and percentage(score) user had on his last use of the program

#### Program
 
- user will create 5 players and each player will consist of name,age,height and weight. all inputs will go trough 
validation process

Operation: Input numbers and characters then press enter key.

#### players data table

- after creating a team user is presented with table 
consisting of his inputs for each player and active metabolic rate value calculated based on inputs.

##### training

- user will have to assign 3 training options to each player and each option has certain value
 validation of inputs is implemented also.

Operation: Input a numeric value and press enter key.

#### meals

- user will assign 3 food options for each player, and 
also each option carries certain calorie value
input validation implemented.

Operation: Input a numeric value and press enter key.

#### final values table 

- after choosing training and meals for all players 
program will perform calculation and present to user table of values thad lead to final result.

#### team performance percentage

- final calculation is done and it's presented to user
with thank you message

#### end of program menu

- after final result user will be presented with 2 options menu
1. go again
2. exit

Operation: Input a numeric value and press enter key.

#### go again

## Technical Design

### Flowchart

The following flowchart summarises the structure and logic of the application.

<details><summary>Flowchart</summary>
<img >
</details>

### Data models

- OOP(object oriented programming) was implemented in certain parts of this programm
- classes -- One class was used to create all players with certain attributes(name,age,weight,height),
and method that calculates active metabolic rate of each player.
- lists -- usage of lists in program is quite often because most of operations and calculations required repetition and iteration multiple times.
- google sheets API - used to manipulate data(CRUD- create ,read update and delete)
- Calorie ninjas API - used to retrieve caloric value from users input 

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for the logic of the program

### Frameworks & Tools

- []() was used to draw program flowchart

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control within VSCode to push the code to GitHub
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used as a remote repository to store project code

- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/) were used to store players details
- [Heroku Platform](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) was used to deploy the project into live environment
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - icons from Font Awesome were used in the footer below the program terminal
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
VSCode was used to write the project code using Code Institute template

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries
- click - used to clear the terminal 
- random - used to generate random palyer values inside given parameters
- typing -used for type hints and return data types in python code
- sys & sleep - used to create a typing effect troughout the project
- time - used to displayed delayed messages in the terminal
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - used to carry out testing on single units in validation.py file

#### Third Party Libraries
- [requests ](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)- used this library to call [CalorieNinjas API](https://calorieninjas.com/api) and get caloric values of assigned meals 
- []()-
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) - used this library to add color to the terminal and enhance user experience.  warning information is marked red while details that user can focus on with green color.Program title was colored blue 
- [email_validator](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/) - used this library to validate if user email input is in correct form
- [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) - JUSTIFICATION: used gspread for data manipulation inside  Google spreadsheet and  interaction with Google APIs
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) -  module used to set up the authentification needed to access the Google API and connect my Service Account with the Credentials function. A creds.json file is created with all details the API needs to access the google account. In deployment to heroku this information is stored in the config var section along with another custom config var provided by code institute.

### Automated Testing
<details><summary>See unit testing</summary>

- I wrote unit tests using Python unittest library
- I tested separate functions to verify correct user input:
  - validation of user email and user name input

I needed to amend the function and add 'Try Except' blocks to handle TypeError.
Initial error called - 'TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()'
