#### Overview
- Using this program user will create 5 players inside given parameters that allow certain creativity.In the next stage user will choose 3 different types of training ,each training got a value (that is not presented to a user, but user is warned that the higher the number of training that value is  higher)
that will Carry a half of the player overall value.next stage calls user to pick 3 food options for each player.also each option has a caloric value (not presented to a user ). so user has to use common sense for food options ,cause caloric value of the food will be compared to a user active metabolic rate that is calculated after input values for each player.Food options will carry another half of player value. final stage of program is giving feedback to user with final result got with calculating both halfs of user value and than getting overall value of team in percentage


#### Main Menu

- Main menu is presented to user with ASCII art of the program title
and short description of program instuctions.
at the bottom of menu user is presented with 2 options 
option to proceed and option to exit the program

### exit
- program is terminated  

#### proceed

- this option will present user with 
another 2 options
1. new user 
2. existing user


#### New user registration (sign-up)

 - user is asked to create username and to put
 the email.
 - user email is validated with python (email_validator) library 
 - after both inputs are validated user credentials are stored into th database(google spreadsheet)


#### existing user

- this option will returnig user to input
email adress. if email is found in database program will retrieve users username and greet user with username and percentage(score) user had on his last use of the program

## Technical Design
<hr>

### Flowchart

 - This Flowchart summarises the structure and logic of the application.

[Flowchart-The_Coach](docs/features/The_Coach_flow.pdf)

### Data models
<hr>

- OOP(object oriented programming) was implemented in certain parts of this programm
- Classes -- One class was used to create all players with certain attributes(name,age,weight,height),
and method that calculates active metabolic rate of each player.
- Lists -- usage of lists in program is quite often because most of operations and calculations required repetition and iteration multiple times.
- Google sheets API - used to manipulate data(CRUD- create ,read update and delete)
- Calorie ninjas API - used to retrieve caloric value from users input 

## Technologies Used

## Future features to implement

<hr>

- Future development of this program would very likely include
1. Training options for longer period of time(week)
2. Diet schedule period of (week or more)
3. Rest schedule period of(week or more)
4. Implementing calculation of training impact to individual athlete and adding that calculation to 
final percentage

## Validation
<hr>

- Since  [PEP8 Validation Service](http://pep8online.com/) site is down and can't be used
PEP8 validator "pycodestyle" was installed directly to  Gitpod Workspace and Im uploading images of all 
python files in my project. All files are cleared of errors and are up to PEP8 standards (if there were any errors there would be a red line inside my source code)

### Automated Testing
<details><summary> unit testing</summary>

- Tests are run  using Python unittest library
- Since i was introduced to "unit testing " when most of source code for program was almost finished only small
part of project was tested.
- User score function was tested for various inputs .

<details><summary>Test passed (various inputs)</summary>
<img src="docs/testing/unit_test/user_score_valid.png">
</details>

- when tested with empty string input typeError should be raised (since function is appending score value that should be int or float value)
so I had to write some more validation for this function

<details><summary>Test Failed(empty string)</summary>
<img src="docs/testing/unit_test/user_score_not_raises.png">
</details>

- After adding code so that typeError is raised on invalid input unit test passed 
<details><summary>Test passed</summary>

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| In validating user inputs when creating player pycodestyle was warning about "too broad exception" in while loop.| add  "ValueError" whan catching the exception with suitable error message|
| When breaking a too long line of code forgot to put "\" to move on next line and didnt match previous indentation| putting "\" when moving on next line and press (tab)
to match previous line indentation|
|when using Colorama and keyword "Fore" to color the  choices that requires user input ,user input was in last color of choice(red)|I colored the blank space white before closing colored choices line so anything inputed after that would be in white color|
|When creating subclass palyer in a for loop and keyword range i set the wrong range cause last number in range is not included|change last number in range to one greater
